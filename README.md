# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis with Gradio Web App

This project uses a machine learning model to classify text (like tweets, reviews, or messages) as **Positive** or **Negative**.

Built during an internship to demonstrate:
- Text preprocessing (NLTK)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression model
- Live prediction using **Gradio**

## ðŸš€ Features
- Clean user interface using Gradio
- Real-time text classification
- Model trained using `LogisticRegression`
- Deployed from Google Colab
